# MXNet Notebooks

These are Jupyter notebooks to help you learn MXNet. I've based them off of documentation and tutorials at [http://mxnet.io/](http://mxnet.io) and the MXNet samples at [https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet-notebooks/](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet-notebooks/).

We start with the basics of building a simple neural network, then move on to training a network, and finally putting it all together and playing with [MNIST data](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and running the network on both GPU and CPU.
